# Mobility-use-case

## Nearby Blocks 
The Nearby Blocks are the core orchestration building blocks for application and service deployment and automation using the NearbyOne orchestration platform. Each Block encapsulates deployment logic, configuration rendering, placement rules, and scaling strategies. Nearby blocks orchestration resources are described as YAML objects that declare the desired state of the system. Then, the platform’s reconciliation engine continuously works to converge the actual state of managed resources to match the declared state, ensuring self-healing and eventual consistency.
The list of available Nearby blocks are: 
- DL streamer: Mobility use case video analytics application.
- Torchserve, an open-source software library for serving PyTorch.
